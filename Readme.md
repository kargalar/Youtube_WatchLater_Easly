# YouTube Watch Later Easy

A tiny Chrome extension that lets you right‑click YouTube videos to quickly add them to Watch Later or remove them from a playlist — no extra menus.

## How it works
- Right‑click any video thumbnail on YouTube.
- On Home, Search, Channel, or Watch pages: it adds the video to Watch Later.
- In a Playlist: it removes the video from that playlist.

That’s it. Install, right‑click, done.
